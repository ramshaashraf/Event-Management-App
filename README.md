# EventManagementApp

Spring Boot application for managing events such as conferences, workshops, or meetups. Users can register for events, organizers can create and manage events, and attendees can view event details, schedule, and speakers. Use Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and integrate with a database to store event and user information.

Add features like: Payment Gateway + Ticketing Service + Email Services

**Tech Stack:**

1. **Backend Framework**: 
   - Spring Boot: Spring Boot provides a robust framework for building Java-based applications with ease, offering features like auto-configuration, dependency injection, and embedded servers.

2. **Database**:
   - MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB: Choose a relational or NoSQL database based on your specific requirements. Relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL are suitable for structured data, while MongoDB offers flexibility for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.

3. **Frontend**:
   - Angular or React: Use a modern JavaScript framework like Angular or React for building the frontend interface of the application. These frameworks offer powerful tools for creating dynamic, responsive user interfaces.

4. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Spring Security: Implement authentication and authorization using Spring Security, which provides robust security features for protecting your application against unauthorized access.

5. **RESTful API**:
   - Spring MVC: Use Spring MVC to build RESTful APIs for handling HTTP requests and responses. This allows for seamless communication between the frontend and backend components of the application.

6. **Data Access**:
   - Spring Data JPA: Simplify data access and persistence using Spring Data JPA, which provides a high-level abstraction for interacting with relational databases. It eliminates the need for boilerplate code and simplifies common data access tasks.

7. **Dependency Management**:
   - Maven or Gradle: Use Maven or Gradle as build automation tools for managing dependencies, compiling code, and packaging the application for deployment.

8. **Testing**:
   - JUnit and Mockito: Write unit tests for your application using JUnit and Mockito to ensure reliability and robustness. Spring Boot provides built-in support for testing, making it easy to write and execute tests.

9. **Deployment**:
   - Docker and Kubernetes: Containerize your application using Docker for easy deployment and scalability. Kubernetes can be used for container orchestration, allowing you to manage and scale your application across multiple containers.

10. **Monitoring and Logging**:
    - Spring Boot Actuator: Monitor and manage your application using Spring Boot Actuator, which provides endpoints for gathering metrics, health checks, and other operational insights. Integrate with logging frameworks like Log4j or SLF4J for capturing and analyzing application logs.

By leveraging these technologies, you can build a robust and scalable Event Management System that meets the needs of both organizers and attendees.
